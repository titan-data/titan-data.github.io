    title: Titan
    headline: Your code. Your environment. Your data.

why-titan:
  - "The rise of git, docker, and DevOps has created a new world where developers can easily build, test, and deploy
  right from their laptop. Despite these advances, developers still struggle to manage structured data with the same
  speed and simplicity. Techniques like SQL scripts, database dumps, and plain text exports still leave a lot of work
  for developers."

  - "Titan is an open source project for developers to manage their data like code. Titan makes it easy to run your
  favorite database in a docker container on your laptop, but with the power of versioning the underlying data.
  Titan's git-like CLI enables developers to clone, commit, checkout, push, and pull data just like code, making
  it easy to rollback to a previous state, build a test data library, or share a structured dataset with
  collaborators."
