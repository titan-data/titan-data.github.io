# Installation

Titan runs on any Windows or MacOS system with [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and
configured to run Linux containers. If you can run `docker run --rm
busybox:latest echo hello`, then you're good to go. If you are using a Linux
system, consult the [Documentation](/docs) to determine if your distribution is
supported.

Once you have docker configured and running, you will need to head to the
[download page](/download) or grab the archive here:
[MacOS]({{ site.data.download.macos }}),
[Windows]({{ site.data.download.windows }}),
[Linux]({{ site.data.download.linux }}). When you extract the archive,
you will have a single `titan` binary that you should place in your path
(such as `/usr/local/bin`). From there, you can run:

{% include code_block.html code='titan install' %}

This will download and configure the titan server container that provides the
storage capabilities required for Titan. This requires connectivity to docker
hub - if you are working behind a firewall consult the [Documentation](/docs)
for more information. Part of this also involves installing ZFS on the
Docker VM or Linux host. If you are using an unsupported Linux distribution,
or a bleeding edge Docker Desktop build, you may find that it has to build
a custom distribution and may fail outright. Reach out to the
[community](/community) for assistance.

# Cloning Your First Repo
We can launch a postgres database simply by cloning this demo repository:

{% include code_block.html code='titan clone s3web://titan-data-demo/hello-world/postgres hello-world' %}

You should now be able to see a repository running:

{%- capture display -%}
$ titan ls
CONTAINER             STATUS
hello-world           running
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='titan ls' %}

If the container fails to start, it may be because you already have PosgreSQL
running on port `5432`, in which case you will need to stop the database  and
try cloning again. We can also verify the contents using `psql`. If you don't
have the postgres tools installed on your laptop, you can run `alias
psql='docker exec hello-world psql'` to use the version shipped in the
container.

{%- capture display -%}
$ psql postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres -t -c 'SELECT * FROM messages;'
 Hello, World!
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='psql postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres -t -c \'SELECT * FROM messages;\'' %}

If you don't have PostgreSQL tools, you can also run the DynamoDB example:

{%- capture display -%}
$ titan clone s3web://titan-data-demo/hello-world/dynamodb hello-world
$ aws dynamodb scan --endpoint http://localhost:8000 --table-name messages | grep '"S"'
                "S": "Hello, World!"
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='titan clone s3web://titan-data-demo/hello-world/dynamodb hello-world' %}

# Creating a New Repository

If you want to start your own database, you can do so with `titan run`, which
run any stateful docker image with a `VOLUME` declaration, such as MongoDB. The
arguments after `--` are standard docker arguments, and must include `-d` and
`--name`.

{% include code_block.html code='titan run -- --name mongo-test -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:latest' %}

# Committing and Checking out State

Using the mongo repository we created in the last step, let's add some data.
If you don't have mongo installed on your laptop, you can run
`alias mongo="docker exec mongo-test mongo"` to use the version shipped in
the container.

{%- capture code -%}
mongo --quiet --eval 'db.employees.insert({firstName:"Ada",lastName:"Lovelace"})'
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html code=code %}

And commit that state:

{%- capture display -%}
$ titan commit -m "First Employee" mongo-test
Commit b040cfe3-aae5-42b2-a41c-6fe2e2baad1c
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='titan commit -m "First Employee" mongo-test' %}

Now, even if we add more data:

{%- capture display -%}
$ mongo --quiet --eval 'db.employees.insert({firstName:"Grace",lastName:"Hopper"})'
WriteResult({ "nInserted" : 1 })
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='mongo --quiet --eval \'db.employees.insert({firstName:"Grace",lastName:"Hopper"})\'' %}
{%- capture display -%}
$ mongo --quiet --eval 'db.employees.find()'
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5d88d264302cca22a91cfb9a"), "firstName" : "Ada", "lastName" : "Lovelace" }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5d88d2f897a6f34e91e46f0d"), "firstName" : "Grace", "lastName" : "Hopper" }
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='mongo --quiet --eval \'db.employees.find()\'' %}

We can checkout or previous state:

{% include code_block.html code='titan checkout --commit b040cfe3-aae5-42b2-a41c-6fe2e2baad1c mongo-test' %}
{%- capture display -%}
$ mongo --quiet --eval 'db.employees.find()'
{ "_id" : ObjectId("5d88d264302cca22a91cfb9a"), "firstName" : "Ada", "lastName" : "Lovelace" }
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include code_block.html display=display code='mongo --quiet --eval \'db.employees.find()\'' %}

# Additional Workflows

With just these simple tools, you can start to create and manage data state to
match your workflow. Want to keep a blank database with your schema pre-applied?
Want to keep some sample data available for you to do destructive testing?
Have a failing test and want to keep the data state around to debug later? Titan
lets developers work with the data they need, when they need it, all on their
laptop environment.

For more information on pushing and pulling data from remote repositories,
more complex workflows to migrate data from existing containers and filesystems,
and a complete breakdown of command line features, see the
[documentation](/docs).

Titan is still a young community, and there are plenty of rough edges and future
ideas in store. Head over to the [future](/future) section to learn more about
what's in store.
